**Course:** Data Analysis and Visualization  
**Institution:** University of Toronto  
**Author:** Unurjargal Batsuuri  
**Date:** December 2024  

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike theft trends in Toronto over the last decade (2014â€“2024) to uncover factors that contribute to theft and provide actionable insights for the cycling community. Using R and RMarkdown, the data was processed, analyzed, and visualized to create a compelling data-driven narrative.

## Objectives

1. **Trend Analysis:** Explore and identify trends in bike theft over time.  
2. **Data Visualization:** Create meaningful visualizations to highlight key findings.  
3. **Community Impact:** Provide insights to help Toronto cyclists make informed decisions to protect their bikes.

## Data and Methods

### Data
- **Source:** Publicly available data on bike thefts in Toronto.  
- **Scope:** Includes reported thefts from 2014 to 2024.  
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Cleaned and standardized the dataset.
  - Addressed missing or inconsistent entries.

### Methods
1. **Data Analysis:** 
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover theft patterns.  
   - Extracted key trends over time and across different neighborhoods.  
2. **Visualization:** 
   - Used RMarkdown to create detailed visualizations such as time series charts and heatmaps.  
   - Designed visuals for clarity and accessibility.  
3. **Report Generation:**
   - Compiled analysis and visuals into an HTML report using RMarkdown.  
   - Structured findings in a narrative format to engage the audience.

## Key Findings

- **Seasonality:** Bike thefts peak during summer months and decline in winter.  
- **Hotspots:** Downtown neighborhoods experience significantly higher theft rates.  
- **Security:** Poorly secured bikes in high-traffic areas are more likely to be stolen.

## Tools Used

- **R:** For data analysis and visualization.  
- **RMarkdown:** To document the analysis and generate a polished HTML report.  
- **ggplot2:** For creating detailed and customizable visualizations.  

## Deliverables

- **HTML Report:** Interactive report summarizing findings and visualizations.  
- **Code:** R scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.  

## How to View

1. Download the HTML report from this repository.
2. Open the report in any web browser to explore the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering meaningful patterns and providing actionable insights. By highlighting the trends and risks associated with bike theft, the report aims to empower Toronto's cycling community.
